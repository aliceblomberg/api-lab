# API Lab - Paper.js

## Description

This project was made as an assignment for the Prototyping course in Interaction Design, where we chose to work with [Paper.js] to learn about how to use an API/Library.

> Paper.js is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of HTML5 Canvas. It is developed by Jürg Lehni & Joonathan Puckey, and distributed under the permissive MIT License.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to explore and extend examples from the library, to practice our programming skills and learn about the basic usage of Git and GitHub. 

### The Library

Paper.js is a vector graphics scripting framework, that works on top of HTML5 Canvas. It’s based on Scriptographer which is used as a scripting environment for Adobe Illustrator. It has its own simple extension of JavaScript named PaperScript which contains extra syntax adapted for working with the library’s own types and objects. Vector Mathematics are treated as first class citizens in Paper.js according to their website and our examples will hopefully portray that. 

## Usage

To try out or work with one of these examples you need to download the paper folder, since it holds the specific version required for these examples, from this repository, as well as the example(s) you’d like to try. When downloaded, open `index.html` to automatically run the example in your web browser or open the js file to edit in your IDE of choice.

If you want to learn more about how to use the library in general, please refer to the documentation found on their [website](http://paperjs.org/reference/global/). 

If you need to work with it for your own project, please follow the installation instructions found in their [README](https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/blob/develop/README.md) on GitHub.

## Contribution

This repository was made by a group consisting of Alice, Aasa, Viggo, Vera and Sara. It will not be maintained since it was a one-time project. However, Paper.js do have their own GitHub repository so if you found this interesting, please check it out [here](https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js).
