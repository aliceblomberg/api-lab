# Division Raster
## Description
This is an annotated example of Division Raster (http://paperjs.org/examples/division-raster). 
As the mouse hovers over the image, the raster grids becomes smaller pixels and reveals a clearer image. 

## Changes
I added some few comments to make the code a bit clearer. 

## Contribution
All of the code is from the source for the example in paper.js. My contribution was modifying the comments a bit.
