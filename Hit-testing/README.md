# Hit-testing
## Description
This is an annotated example of [your example](https://paperjs.org/examples/yourexample). 
It called Hit-testing, it is a user-control process that the user can get interact with random shapes and with random colors. The user can select a shape and change its size, layout design and position.

## Reflection
Why highlight this example? What is interesting about it? How can it be relevant for Interaction Design?

This example makes me so exciting to use it from the first time I saw it. Because it contains different shapes of different colors that I can get interact with it in many different ways. Hit-testing is so easy and simple to use, it can be done by using a mouse cursor, and the user will directly see the changes that he makes. In addition, there are many options to use this example: 1- You can select the shape and use its segments to change the layout design of the shape.
         2- By dragging the point of the segment you can change shape's size and aim it in the desired direction.
         3- You are able to create a new segment to the shape by clicking on the stroke and then just drag it wherever you want.

The thing that can be related to interaction design is when you put the mouse cursor over a shape, you are able to see the stroke of the shape with its segments even if the shape is covered by other shapes. It is so useful to see how the shape looks like without moving the shapes that are over it. 

Het-testing can be used for ordering like if each shape has a small text inside it and you want to arrange your ideas in some way, so you can move the shapes to gather the ideas together.

Another way that Het-testing can be used when you want to create an interactive game for kids like shapes challenge and make them identify the shapes related to the pictures.

Furthermore, this example makes me inspired to create more shapes or to draw many beautiful drawings, just for fun. There was actually one thing that makes the example hard to use for drawing, it is when you create a new segment point in the stroke of the shape you are not able to remove it then, so the user has to be careful when he wants to click on the segments to use it in the right way.
