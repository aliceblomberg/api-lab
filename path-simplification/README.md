# Path Simplification

## Description
The example enables the smoothening of path by simplifying line segments. 
This is an annotated example of Path Simplification (http://paperjs.org/examples/path-simplification). 

## Changes
I added some comments to make the code clearer and also added .colorfill method to add color to the path. 
Also, I made the stroke width thicker and increased the value of the .simplify method. 

## Who contributed
All of the code is from the source for the example in paper.js. My contribution was modifying the comments and some values in the code.
