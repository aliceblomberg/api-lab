# Name of the example/tutorial
## Description

Round rectangle is a graphic shape related to mouse cursor, it is a colorful round rectangle which you can move it wherever you want on the screen depending on the mouse position. 

## Reflection
Why highlight this example? What is interesting about it? How can it be relevant for Interaction Design?

I choose this example because the idea seemed interesting for me that you can identify the position of the mouse from the first look of the screen. In main.js I decided to make some changes to the shape that related to the mouse to make it easier and more simple. I changed the shape to a small circle which has yellow, white and black colors, the size has been smaller to make it more interactive. 

It can be relevant to interaction design if someone has disabilities to identify the position od mouse cursor on a big screen. So it will be easier to find it by the new shape. 

It can be used also for technical games to make the design more colorful by using an appropriate shape for the game.
