# Candy Crash

## Description
This is an annotated example of Candy Crash(https://paperjs.org/examples/candy-crash). 

## Reflection
Candy-crash works with a combination of vector graphics and smoothing functions to create randomly moving bouncy balls. For Interaction Design purposes, the creation of movement and feedback are particularly interesting. I can see it being a useful example for using Paper.js to create an Interactive demographics map. This could show members within a larger set, to get a more individualized appreciation on for example diversity.

## How to get started
- `candy_crash.js`: commented version of the original Candy Crash code
- `candy_crash_new.js`: edited version of the original, with more smaller balls that move in a horizontal direction.

Open `index.html` in your web browser. This will automatically load and run the edited example. To run the the original code, open `index.html` and change the file referenced by the script tag `candy_crash.js`.
